## Overview

The DIGIT Recognizer project is a machine learning project that employs the Keras deep learning framework with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to recognize handwritten digits. 
This project aims to build and train a neural network model that can accurately identify and classify handwritten digits (0-9) from images.

## Features

- **Keras Neural Network Model**: The project utilizes Keras, a high-level neural networks API, to build a neural network architecture for digit recognition.
  
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: SGD is used as the optimization algorithm to train the neural network.
  
- **CSV Dataset**: The project includes a CSV dataset containing labeled digit images, which serves as the training and testing data.
  
- **Model Training**: The neural network model is trained on the provided dataset to learn the patterns and features associated with each digit.

- **Digit Recognition**: Once trained, the model can recognize and classify handwritten digits from input images.
